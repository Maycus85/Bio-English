## My Journey into Cloud & Modern Infrastructure

I originally came from a technical background (Automation & Computer Technology) and spent over 15 years working independently in the music and digital media industry: studio workflows, web projects, hosting, Linux systems, Shopify setups, and troubleshooting.

In 2026, I decided to professionalize this foundation and move fully into **Cloud Administration, Modern Endpoint Management, and Security Engineering**.

My long-term goal: transition from classical Windows client environments into modern **Azure, AWS, and Zero-Trust architectures**.

---

## Focus Areas: Endpoint Management, Cloud Administration & Security

I specialize in:

- **Modern Endpoint Management (Intune, Autopilot, Windows 365)**
- **Cloud Identity & Access Management (Azure Entra ID + AWS IAM)**
- **Cloud Administration (Azure Compute, Networking, Security, Monitoring)**
- **Zero Trust & Security Hardening**
- **Automation & Scripting (PowerShell – later Terraform & Python)**

This repository functions as both my **learning backlog** and a **hands-on lab**, mirroring real enterprise workflows.
